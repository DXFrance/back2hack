# What kind of services can I expect in Azure for this Hackathon?

Here is a selection of Azure services that you may find useful  

You can go to [azure.com](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), Documentation. The main chapters of interest for this Hackathon are: 

- Compute
    - Windows Virtual Machines: create your own Windows Virtual Machine, connect thru Remote Desktop protocol to it and install whatever you need
    - Linux Virtual Machines: create your own Linux Virtual Machine, connect thru SSH to it and install whatever you need
- Web & Mobile
	- App Service (Web Apps, Mobile Apps, API Apps, Logic Apps) est un PaaS assez simple Ã  utiliser pour exposer un backend d'applications mobile, un site Web, des API ou un workflow d'appels d'API
- Data & Storage
    - Storage: the service where your dataset will be available to you. It can store virtual hard disks, files, HDInsight considers it as its default Hadoop distributed file system
    - SQL Data Warehouse: create your own relational database that can run on multiple nodes and gets data from its Polybase engine (define an external table to Azure storage and load data that way)
- Intelligence
    - Cognitive Services: deep learning made easy. Just use the API that are made available to you for images, language, and other subjects
- Analytics
    - Data Lake Analytics: serverless big data engine. Language is U-SQL, a mix of SQL and procedural (C#)
    - HDInsight: Spark, Hadoop, Storm, HBase as a service
    - Machine Learning: Develop your own Machine Learning learning and scoring experiments with Microsoft algorithms, or R, or Python (Anaconda distribution). You can do that from the Azure ML Studio (HTML5) or a Jupyter notebook
- Developer Services
    - Visual Studio Team Services: get your own private git repo, with its bug database and more
